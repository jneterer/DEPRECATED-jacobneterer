          Online Express is JLG's new and improved eCommerce platform. OLE's front-end is built in Angular using Angular Material
          design. I specifically contributed to the front end development, building out components for user accounts, shopping cart, 
          checkout, and many other pages. This project gave me experience in many different areas including Angular, Okta, Oracle ATG 
          Commerce, SVN, and more.

          I have had the privilege of working for JLG since June of 2018. I started out as an intern for the months of
          June and July but was able to continue through the rest of the year as a temporary employee, eventually being
          hired full-time once I graduated college in January of 2019. I had the once in a lifetime opportunity to
          begin contributing to OLE the moment I began my internship. I was thrown into the fire, one of my first tasks being
          setting up authentication for the application. Since then, I have been a main contributor for the rest of the site
          and continue to help maintain it today.

        open-source text classification tool
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My Data Labeler is an open-source text classification tool. I believe there aren't enough open source
          text classification tools out there, so I built my own! It is still a work in progress and will hopefully
          be completed sometime early this year (2020). It is built on Angular as the front-end,
          MongoDB as the database, and MongoDB Stitch for user management and a server-less back-end. Also, I manage the
          code using git and is stored on GitHub. I am hoping to have a website for this project in the near future.

          This project stems from one of my passions: language. Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated
          with the world's languages. In high school I took all 5 available Spanish courses, earned my Minor in Spanish
          at college, and studied in Burgos, Spain for 2 months in the summer of my sophomore year. Language translators 
          like Google Translate (although relatively inaccurate) intruiged me. That drove me to learn more about natural
          language processing and deep learning. In my senior year of college I studied this and submitted a paper to  
          the West Virginia Academy of Science and got to present my studies at their annual conference.
